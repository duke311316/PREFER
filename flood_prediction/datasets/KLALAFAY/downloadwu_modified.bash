    This script connects to stationId with your API key and downloads
    all data in reverse order from yearmonthday (that you enter) until
    the station stops returning data for 30 sequential days. 

    OPTIONS:
    -a apikey from weatherunderground
    -h gives this help
    -s <yourstationId> will use your stationId instead of the default (KLALAFAY248)
    -v increases verbosity, perhaps later
    -f <outputfilename> will write to your own output filename
    -d <YYYYMMDD> will start at that yearmonthday
